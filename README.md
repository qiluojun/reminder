# fisrt thing to say  
Wow! You discovered this simple program! I feel a bit ashamed - because this program is really too simple!ü§£

But I still chose to open this repository - I believe programming experts are friendly! Not overly demanding of a programming rookie's first work~

I hope you won't be scared away by the rudimentary program haha~I will slowly update this program, and perhaps one day, this program will actually help others! Looking forward to it!(‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)

Also, I would like to thank [skywind3000][skywind3000](https://github.com/skywind3000/PyStand)!!!Your Zhihu tutorials and GitHub library have benefited me a lot!ü•≥

# why is it here ? 
The reason why it appears here is not only to commemorate, but also to practice the ability to use git to control version development.

On the one hand, this is the first program I wrote, although it was very simple (both in terms of functionality and UI), it still allowed me to experience the joy of autonomous programming. Thank you very much to the AI teachers who helped me along the way. Without you, I would definitely have given up when the first bug popped up. Its beginning was just a small interest, and I never imagined that a rough little software from over a year ago would guide me towards the path I am today, it's amazing!

On the other hand, I am starting to practice using git to control version development. Although I have been exposed to GitHub for a long time and have seen various magical software from various experts on it, I never imagined that one day I would join this big family as a beginner. Since it's for practicing, of course I'll start with my simplest program. After I become familiar with the process, I will gradually add other slightly more complex programs~

Finally, long live open-source ideology! Long live learning and sharing!

# what can it do

## current functions
it's very simple!
Just click the exe file, and input the period of time, choose or input the reminding text. Then when the time is up, you will see an annoying little window showing the text~

## future plan

-  **adding system tray** --now you can close the window without shutting down the whole program! ‚Üí V1.1

- **Delete existing reminders** -- This way you don't have to worry about accidentally setting unwanted reminders~

- **Built in interface to change remind text**--No need to modify through txt file anymore! Not at all elegant!

- **Linking with other LAE programs**--HEHE, such a simple program is certainly just a part of the big picture~
